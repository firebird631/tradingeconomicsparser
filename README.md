Basic scrapper for current Economic Calendar for TradingEconomics.com

Don't tell them :) It works today, but as a scrapper it will never be guaranteed they will never changes theirs formats.

It seems not possible (basically) to filter per date.

Features :
 - Level of impact 1 2 3
 - Date time in UTC format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
 - Event key codes
 - Attempt to filter event key codes with more easier code (NFP, FOMC, PMI) (Work In Progress)


By me a coffee or a Lambo :
