# Economic Events Fetchers & Scrappers #

## tradingeconomiscalendarscrapper.py ##

Basic scrapper for current Economic Calendar for TradingEconomics.com

Don't tell them :) It works today, but as a scrapper it will never be guaranteed they will never changes theirs formats.

It seems not possible (basically) to fetch per date without using a headless browser.

Features :
 - Latests economics calendar events
 - Level of impact 1 2 3
 - Date time in UTC format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
 - Event key codes
 - Attempt to filter event key codes with more easier code (NFP, FOMC, PMI) (Work In Progress)


## dailyfxcalendarfetcher.py ##

Full history of economic calendar since 2013.

Simple launch the script and it will fetch in approximatively 30 minutes the full history into JSON files.
